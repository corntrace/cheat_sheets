The Search/Replace magic marks :)
---------------------------------
If you want to append something search out, you could use the following code:

    s/someword/&\r/

In this code, the `&` means the matching result of previous regular expression.

In another situation, you would notice there's a litter different with normal
regular expression:

    s/.\{78\}/&\r/

It should be `/.{78}/` in normal regular expression. But in **VIM** it should be
wrote as `/.\{78\}/`
