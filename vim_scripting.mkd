The different between `'` and `"`
---------------------------------
Both `'` and `"` could be used to build strings, but there's a different between them when special character
in the string. For example:

    echo "normal ?\\A\<CR>"			"output => normal ?\A

The special characters are all be escaped. While this:

    echo 'normal ?\\A\<CR>'			"output => normal ?\\A\<CR>

The special characters are remained.
