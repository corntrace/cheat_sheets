What is passive group?
----------------------
At first, a 'group' means a string of letters:

    /\d (.+) and \d (.+)/

This would match the following sentence:
> I have one apple and tow bananas

And get tow matching results:

    $1 = "apple"
		$2 = "bananas"

But if I don't want the first result, I could using the **Passive Group**

    /\d (?:.+) and \d (.+)/

Then I could get the matching result:

    $1 = "bananas"
